Backdrop Contributed Project Agreement
--------------------------------------

By joining the [Backdrop Contributed Project Group](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib) (Backdrop Contrib, for short) you agree to the following:

1. You will not push changes to a repository for which you are not a current maintainer (even though joining the Backdrop Contrib group will grant you access to push to any project within).

1. You must agree to license your code contributions as GPLv2 or later.

1. Any project you create or maintain must include a copy of the [GPL v2 `LICENSE.txt` file](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/examples/LICENSE.txt) in the root of your repository. The GPLv2 license applies to all code that directly interacts with parts of Backdrop licensed as GPLv2 or later.  See for the [Backdrop License FAQ](https://backdropcms.org/license) for a more detailed explanation.

1. You must confirm that you have the right to distribute any additional code, libraries, images, fonts or other assets written or created by any third party with code licensed as GPLv2 or later.

1. Any project you create or maintain must include a `README.md` file containing at the least the following:
  1. A description of the project
  1. Basic documentation
  1. License information for the project (GPL v2)
  1. License information for any additional assets (SIL OFL fonts, CC-SA images, etc)
  1. A list of the current maintainers for the Backdrop project
  1. Credits acknowledging past maintainers for the Backdrop or Drupal projects

  You may use this [example README.md](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/examples/README.md) to get started.

1. You will work with the Backdrop Security Team to address any vulnerabilities in any project you create or maintain, if necessary.

1. Any project you create or maintain will have the GitHub issue tracker enabled for official communication.

1. If any of the above requirements are not met, your access to the Backdrop Contrib group -- including all projects and even those that you may have originally authored -- may be revoked.

1. If your project becomes abandoned and you do not respond to requests in the issue tracker within 2 weeks, your project may be modified by a Backdrop Contrib administrator without your explicit consent.

Abandoned Projects
------------------

You may apply to adopt an abandoned project. The procedure is as follows:

1. If you haven't already, please join the Backdrop Contrib group by submitting an application (see above).

1. File an issue with the current project requesting to help maintain the project.

  - If written permission is granted by a current maintainer, create a PR that adds your name to the README.md file in the list of maintainers.
  - If a current maintainer does not respond within 2 weeks [create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new) to take over the project. Please include a link to the issue you filed with the abandoned project.

1. After confirming the project has been abandoned, a Backdrop Contrib administrator will add your name to the list of maintainers in that project's README.md file.

1. You may now maintain the project directly as though given permission by the project maintainers, and likewise now grant permission to others to maintain the project.
