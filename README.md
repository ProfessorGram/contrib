Backdrop Contributed Project Group Application
==============================================

Use this project to express interest in joining the growing community of developers maintaining a module or theme hosted at https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/.

To apply simply create a request as an issue at https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new

You don't have to wait for access to Backdrop Contributed Project Group to share your code, nor is it required.  You can start writing or porting a project to Backdrop in your own GitHub account (or under a personal account hosted elsewhere). If you've already started a project, please include a link to the module or theme you have written. After joining the Backdrop Contributed Project Group, you will be able to transfer the entire repository to live under `https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/[your_project_name]`

Backdrop Contributed Project Author Agreement
---------------------------------------------

By publishing a project in the [Backdrop Contributed Project Group](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib) (Backdrop Contrib for short), you must agree to the following:

1. You will not push changes to a repository for which you are not a maintainer; even though joining the Backdrop Contrib group will grant you technical permission to push to any project within.

1. You must agree to license your contributions as GPLv2 or later.

1. You must include a copy of the [GPL v2 `LICENSE.txt` file](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/examples/LICENSE.txt) in the root of your repository.  The GPLv2 license applies to all code that directly interacts with parts of Backdrop licensed as GPLv2 or later.  See for the [Backdrop License FAQ](https://backdropcms.org/license) for a more detailed explaination.    

1. You must confirm that you have the right to distribute any additional code, libraries, images, fonts or other assets written or created by any third party with code licensed as GPLv2 or later. 

1. You must include a `README.md` with all projects, including at the least the following:
  1. A description of the project
  1. Basic documentation
  1. License information for the project (GPL v2)
  1. License information for any additional assets (SIL OFL fonts, CC-SA images, etc) 
  1. A list of the current maintainers for the Backdrop project
  1. A list of the past maintainers for the Backdrop or Drupal project

  You may use this [example README.md](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/examples/README.md) to get started.
1. You will work with the Backdrop Security Team to address any vulnerabilities in your code if necessary.

1. You will enable the GitHub issue tracker for official communication.

1. If you fail to do any of the above, your access to the Backdrop Contrib group -- including all projects and even those that you may have originally authored -- may be revoked.

1. If your project becomes abandoned and you do not respond to requests in the issue tracker within 2 weeks, your project may be modified by a Backdrop Contrib administrator without your explicit consent.

Process for Abandoned Projects
-----------------------------

If you feel a project in the Backdrop Contrib group has been abandoned, you may apply to adopt that project. To do so:

1. Join the Backdrop Contrib group by submitting an application (see above).

1. File an issue with the current project, requesting to help maintain the project. If written permission is granted by a current maintainer, add your name to the README.md file in the list of maintainers.

1. If the current maintainers do not respond within 2 weeks. [Create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new) to take over the project, including a link to the issue you filed with the abandoned project.

1. After confirming the project has been abandoned, a Backdrop Contrib administrator will add your name to the list of maintainers in that project's README.md file.

1. You may now maintain the project directly as though given permission by the project maintainers and likewise now grant permission to others to maintain the project.
