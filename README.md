Backdrop Contributed Module Group Application
=============================================

This project allows you to apply to join the [contributed module developer team](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/).

To apply simply create a request as an issue at https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new

If you have already written or ported a module to Backdrop, please include a link to the module you have written, hosted either on Github under a personal account or elsewhere. After joining the Backdrop contributed modules group, you will be able to transfer the entire repository to live under `https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/[your_module_name]`

Backdrop Contributed Module Author Agreement
--------------------------------------------

By publishing a module in the [Backdrop Contributed module group](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib) (Backdrop Contrib for short), you must agree to the following:

1. You promise that you will not push changes to a repository for which you are not a maintainer; even though joining the Backdrop Contrib group will grant you technical permission to push to any project within.
1. All code published in the Backdrop Contrib must be licensed as GPL v2. You MUST include a `LICENSE` file in your repository indicating the code as GPL v2.
1. All code must be accompanied by a `README.md` at the very least including:
  1. A description of the project
  1. Basic documentation
  1. License information (GPL v2)
  1. A list of the current maintainers for the project
1. If necessary, you will work with the Backdrop Security Team to address any vulnerabilities in your code.
1. The project repository must have the GitHub issue tracker enabled for official communication.
1. If your module becomes abandoned and you do not respond to requests in the issue tracker within 2 weeks, your project may be adopted or modified by a Backdrop Contrib administrator without your explicit consent.
1. If you are unable or unwilling to do any of the above, your access to the Backdrop Contrib group -- including all projects including those that you may have originally authored -- may be revoked.

Process for Abandoned Modules
-----------------------------

If you feel a module in the Backdrop Contrib group has been abandoned, you may apply to adopt that module. To do so:

1. Join the Backdrop Contrib group by submitting an application (see above).
1. File an issue with the current project, requesting to help maintain the project. If written permission is granted by a current maintainer, add your name to the README.md file in the list of maintainers.
1. If the current maintainers do not respond within 2 weeks. [Create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new) to take over the module, including a link to the issue you filed with the abandoned project.
1. After confirming the module has been abandoned, a Backdrop Contrib administrator will add your name to the list of maintainers in that project's README.md file.
1. You may now maintain the module directly as though given permission by the module maintainers and likewise now grant permission to others to maintain the module.
