=============================================

This project allows you to apply to join the [contributed module developer team](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/).

To apply simply create a request as an issue at https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new

If you have already written or ported a module to Backdrop, please include a link to the module you have written, hosted either on Github under a personal account or elsewhere. After joining the Backdrop contributed modules group, you will be able to transfer the entire repository to live under `https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/[your_module_name]`
