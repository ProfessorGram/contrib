**Please do not use this issue queue to request a security release**

You will need to work with the Backdrop Security Team in order to make a
security release for your project. Please contact security@backdropcms.org to
begin this process. Pleas include the name of your project, and your anticiapted
release date.

You and the security team will choose a Wednesday to coordinate the release, and
on that day, when you publish the release on GitHub, someone from the Backdrop
Security Team will need to update the project release node on backdropcms.org
to inidciate that a release is a security release.

This indication will also trigger an email to go out to everyone who has
requested to be notified about security relases.
