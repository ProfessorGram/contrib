**Thank you for supporting the Backdrop community!**

Please note the procedure to add a new maintainer to a project:

1. Please join the Backdrop Contrib group (if you have not already) by
   submitting [an application](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/new?assignees=klonos&labels=Maintainer+application&template=application-to-join-the-contrib-group.md&title=Application+to+join+the+Contrib+Group%3A).
2. File an issue in the current project's issue queue offering to help maintain
   that project.
3. Create a PR for that project that adds your name to the README.md file in
   the list of maintainers. <!-- The project maintainer, or a backdrop-contrib
   administrator, will merge this PR to accept your offer of help. -->
4. If the project does not have a listed maintainer, or if a current maintainer
   does not respond within 2 weeks, create *this issue* to take over the project.

**Please include a link to the issue you filed for the project.**
<!-- example: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/feeds_jsonpath_parser/issues/7 -->

**Please include a link to the PR that adds your name to the README.md file.**
<!-- example: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/feeds_jsonpath_parser/pull/8 -->

<!-- After confirming the project has been abandoned for a period of 2 weeks or
more, a Backdrop Contrib administrator will add your name to the list of
maintainers in that project's README.md file, and grant you admin access to the
project. -->
